Handwriting Recognition with Tensorflow . 



Libraries:

Numpy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
a powerful N-dimensional array object
sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

Pandas
pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis                 tools for the Python programming language.

Tensorflow

Another numerical computation library that runs very fast computations that can run on your CPU or GPU
Google Brain, Apache 2.0 license
Theano & Tensorflow are used primarily for research and development in the deep learning field
Deep Learning neural network from scratch, use the above
Great for inventing new deep learning neural networks, deep learning models, lots of line of code

Keras

Wrapper for Theano + Tensorflow
Amazing library to build deep neural networks in a few lines of code
Very powerful deep neural networks in few lines of code
based on Theano and Tensorflow
Sci-kit Learn (Machine Learning models), Keras (Deep Learning models)



$ pip install tensorflow
$ pip install keras
$ conda update --all
